> **Disclaimer**
> The plenigo SDK is an open source wrapper around the [plenigo API](https://api.plenigo.com).
> It is not guaranteed to be feature complete. We try to keep it as current as possible, but it is still possible that features are missing. We are happy to accept push requests for missing functionality.

A detailed usage guide can be found in our [documentation](https://plenigo.github.io/sdks/php).

If you find any problems or bugs please feel free to open up a ticket in the [tracker](https://github.com/plenigo/plenigo_php_sdk/issues). Bugs regarding the SDK are only handled if they are inserted there.

A composer package can be found on [packagist.org](https://packagist.org/packages/plenigo/plenigo-php-sdk).
